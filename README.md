# gateware-ts

**gateware-ts** is a *hardware definition library* written in TypeScript for generating Verilog code, ready to be piped into the open source FPGA toolchain.

The project aims to:

- Create a type-safe and modular way of specifying RTL hardware
- Integrate and facilitate the use of the open source FPGA toolchains
- Be approachable and usable by JavaScript and TypeScript developers
