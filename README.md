# gateware-ts

**gateware-ts** is a *hardware definition library* written in TypeScript for generating Verilog code, ready to be piped into the open source FPGA toolchain.

The project aims to:

- Create a type-safe and modular way of specifying RTL hardware
- Integrate and facilitate the use of the open source FPGA toolchains
- Be approachable and usable by JavaScript and TypeScript developers

## Examples

A few illustrative examples can be found in the [examples directory](./examples) (more to come in the future).

## Project Status

This project is very much a work in progress, and as such is likely to contain many bugs and rough edges. If you're looking for a production ready embedded HDL, the nMigen is definitely a better bet! But if you're looking to learn and hack on FPGAs in a type safe language, give this project a go.
